Create a Final Grade Calculator. (100 points)Requirements:I. The system shall ingest student_grades_input.txt (see next page). This comma delimited input text filecontains the names and grades of 30 students. Each student has grades for six assignments: 3Homework Assignments, 1 Midterm, 1 Project, and 1 Final.II. The system shall compute the final numerical grade for each student using the following:final_numerical_grade = 0.45*[(HW1+HW2+HW3)/3] + 0.25*Project + 0.30*[(Midterm+Final)/2]III. The system shall use the following to determine the final letter grade:Final Numerical Grade Final Letter Grade90 – 100 A80 – 89 B70 – 79 C60 – 69 D0 – 59 FIV. The system shall use a GUI to display the final letter grade for each student. Note, a scroll bar may beneeded to fit all the names and grades within the GUI. Please be sure to include screenshots that detailthe entire output. More than one screenshot may be required.V. At the bottom of the GUI, include the total number of A’s, B’s, C’s, D’s, and F’s.Instructions:Develop a report that describes the system architecture, provides an overview of the source code, andaddresses each of the five requirements (above). Note, all responses should be contained in ONE WORD orPDF document. Other formats will not be accepted.Do your best! This assignment is worth 25% of your final grade!student_grades_input.txtName,HW1,HW2,HW3,Midterm,Project,FinalStephen Curry,100,100,95,100,85,98Michael Jordan,100,100,100,100,90,90Kobe Bryant,95,90,98,91,87,92Kevin Durant,92,98,94,94,88,94Russell Westbrook,90,90,93,90,80,93Lebron James,98,100,97,98,89,91Klay Thompson,90,89,94,91,88,95Chris Paul,94,85,100,94,85,94Reggie Miller,100,94,95,96,94,91Tim Duncan,90,91,97,98,89,91Tony Parker,97,95,96,92,88,94Steve Nash,100,80,90,94,96,96Karl Malone,89,70,86,96,85,80Scottie Pippen,88,75,70,90,94,96Allen Iverson,85,80,69,91,75,86Tim Hardaway,100,0,75,65,95,89Kevin Garnett,89,56,91,88,79,73Kyrie Irving,75,64,89,70,90,82Vince Carter,91,89,76,64,0,70Tracy McGrady,88,76,54,61,91,79Larry Bird,0,86,100,96,84,88Magic Johnson,87,80,70,66,77,91Chris Mullin,99,87,94,0,86,84John Stockton,89,91,96,88,85,80David Robinson,65,56,88,46,77,90Charles Barkley,78,60,89,79,35,0Derrick Rose,94,78,90,86,80,88Dwayne Wade,90,56,86,70,62,30Carmelo Anthony,60,0,50,84,46,92Ray Allen,97,64,95,75,88,89
